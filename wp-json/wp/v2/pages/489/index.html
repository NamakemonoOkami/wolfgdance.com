As such, there is little coherency and some of the songs are not as &#8220;musical&#8221; as others (although I think that they are all pretty good). It is ordered in chronological order from the time that the dance was first performed. Most of these works were also choreographed by me, however there were a few that I have worked with friends and family to create for their dances too. I initially wanted to share this music as an example of my work, however after listening to the tracks again I have realized that it also stands as a sort of journal of my artistic growth as a musician, which I find to be meaningful on its own. If you want to check out the dances that these songs were created for, I have some of them (particularly the more recent ones) on the <a href=\"https:\/\/wolfgdancecom.local\/media\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/wolfgdancecom.local\/media\/\">Media<\/a> page. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-advanced-column-4050fd63\" class=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-advanced-column\">\n<iframe class=\"lazyload\" style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 786px;\" data-src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=1639051325\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=0687f5\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"https:\/\/wolfganggoluska.bandcamp.com\/album\/songs-for-dances\">Songs for Dances by Wolfgang Goluska<\/a><\/iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also find this album on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrDnbi2v6OkkznWD2lxMJ97BSEuy4pnay\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrDnbi2v6OkkznWD2lxMJ97BSEuy4pnay\">YouTube<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-advanced-columns-105467eb\" class=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-advanced-columns has-2-columns has-desktop-twoOne-layout has-tablet-equal-layout has-mobile-collapsedRows-layout has-vertical-unset\"><div class=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-advanced-columns-overlay\"><\/div><div class=\"innerblocks-wrap\">\n<div id=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-advanced-column-d3571bd8\" class=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-advanced-column\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s this music thing about Though?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been making music for about as long as I have been dancing. It has become a very integral part of my life and a great creative counterpart to my work as a dancer. As I began making choreography, I realized that I had the opportunity to combine these two things that I love. So, I began writing the music for dances that I make and eventually began working with friends and family on projects too. This initially just started off because it gave me a different level of control over my creative process, but as I kept doing it I realized that there were many pragmatic reasons to continue it. First and foremost, it is much safer for me to do legally, especially with screen dance works. Copyright law is stressful and I was able to avoid the hassle of dealing with much of that by just creating my own music. It also allows me to experiment with different creative processes and create more cohesive works as most of my music is written for the dance itself. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I understand the struggle for others to find music that they can use in their works (on the stage, screen, or wherever else) I have decided to release the music that I have created for dances and extend an invitation for others to use these songs with their own work. <em><strong>My only ask is that you credit me.<\/strong><\/em> If you end up making a profit off of a work that uses my music, I do accept donations but I am not going to require them. While I yearn to be financially stable, I think that it is more important to share our art with the world so we can continue creating, inspiring, collaborating, remixing, making, breaking, remaking and discovering. Art fuels art. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-advanced-column-f17790e4\" class=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-advanced-column\">\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reach out!<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like my work and would like to inquire about collaborating on a project, send me a message!
