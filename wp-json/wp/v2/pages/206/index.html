Following that we will work through a variation of the traditional ballet class structure with exercises designed to bounce between working on the pulse, with various rhythms and without a clear pulse. This will culminate in a creative exercise where the students will create a combo that demonstrates its own rhythms and pulses, which we will then discuss as a part of our cooldown.<br><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Lesson 2 &#8211; Accents<\/strong> <br><strong>Objectives <\/strong><br>Students will: <br>-Have an increased understanding of accents in relation to ballet movement.<br>-Have an increased understanding of musicality and how it relates to ballet technique.<br>-Have an increased understanding of the choices that you can make within the structure of a ballet class <br><strong>Narrative<\/strong><br>Following a brief warm-up students will be given combinations designed to allow them to explore the concept without having to fully improvise. After that will be a variation on a traditional ballet class structure with exercises designed to work with accents, against accents, with changing accents and without accents. Towards the end of the class, the students will have an opportunity to apply their knowledge in a small choreographic exercise, which we will then discuss as a closer to our class.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Lesson 3 \u2013 Time Signatures<\/strong> <br><strong>Objectives<\/strong><br>Students will: <br>-Have a better understanding of what a time signature is.<br>-Be able to recognize and recall the time signatures most often used in ballet.<br>-Have a better understanding of the rhythmic qualities of movements and how they fit into certain time signatures. <br><strong>Narrative<\/strong><br>This class is designed to be similar to the &#8220;Rhythm vs Pulse&#8221; class to allow the students to dive deeper into their understanding of the movement and concepts. As such, it begins with a similar warm-up that has been tweaked to better fit the concept of time signatures. This is followed by some improvisation based exercises and a set of exercises that should be familiar to the students so that we can dive deeper into their artistry. This culminates in a choreographic exercise that emphasizes adaptation. We will then conclude with a brief discussion about it as a part of our cooldown.<br><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Lesson 4 \u2013 Musical Phrasing<\/strong><br><strong>Objectives<\/strong><br>Students will: <br>-Have a greater understanding of musical phrasing.<br>-Have a better understanding of how phrasing can be used in dance.<br>-Have an idea of how to use phrasing to enhance personal artistry <br><strong>Narrative<\/strong><br>This class is designed to be similar to the &#8220;Accents&#8221; class to further reinforce ideas introduced earlier while diving deeper into new levels of understanding. This begins with a brief warm-up followed by some simple exercises that are designed to allow the students to explore the concept. After that, we will move through a &#8220;traditional&#8221; ballet class with exercises both designed for this purpose and pulled from earlier in the unit with tweaks for this concept. As the end of class the students will play a small choreographic game where they will have to solve challenges of musical phrasing, followed by a brief discussion and cooldown.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-advanced-column-ab9100e3\" class=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-advanced-column\">\n<div id=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-tabs-b2369395\" class=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-tabs\"><div class=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-tabs__content\">\n<div data-title=\"Tab 1\" class=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-tabs-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-tabs-item__header\" tabindex=\"0\">Tab 1<\/div><div class=\"wp-block-themeisle-blocks-tabs-item__content\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\">Rhythm vs Pulse<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Objectives<\/strong> <br>After this lesson, students will: <br>-Have a better understanding of the difference between pulse and rhythm in music.<br>-Have a better idea of how the concepts of pulse and rhythm connect to dance.<br>-Be able to better apply these ideas to their own artistry both in phrase work and in improvisation. &nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Materials<\/strong>: Device to play music\/metronome<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Methodology<\/strong>: Teacher led movement, discussion, improvisation and phrase work.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Warming Up<\/strong>: <br>Brain dance (to be done to a metronome or similar basic pulse): <br>Breath: Breathing on your own time. <br>Tactile:&nbsp; Patting different rhythms on different parts of the body, in a call and response pattern Core\/Distal: Curling and unfurling at different rates relative to the pulse (in 8\u2019s, 4\u2019s, 2\u2019s, and 1\u2019s) Head\/Tail: Move head\/tail on beat\/pulse, move head on beat and tail on half-time and vice versa. Upper\/Lower: Partner up and move upper body to a rhythm for four counts. Then follow your partners rhythm for four counts before adding on your own four counts. So each time you move, you are dancing eight counts, four of the previous rhythm and four of a new one. Repeat process with lower body. <br>Body Half: A continuation of the previous exercise, working with a different partner, use one half of your body to make the rhythm, then the partner is going to copy that rhythm with their body half, then make their own rhythm. <br>Cross-Lateral: Walking on the pulse then to double time, half time and dancers\u2019 choice rhythm Vestibular: Stand on one leg, try to move each limb to a different rhythm.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Exploring the Concept:<\/strong> <br>Dancers will explore finding the pulse and rhythm of the music and explore different ways to move with that in mind. They will begin by finding their own interpretation of the pulse, then move to that interpretation, then contrast it with various rhythms. &nbsp; Dancers will dance in 2-3 minute bursts to 3-4 songs with a variety of rhythms, meters, tones, and&nbsp; tempos.

I believe that dance can be anything, but to truly understand and appreciate it, one needs to learn the rules and techniques of various styles. Therefore, my teaching philosophy emphasizes the importance of self-discipline, contextual understanding, and body awareness while allowing for experimentation and expression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My role as an educator is to pass on my knowledge and experience to my students and teach them about the context and tradition of the styles that I teach so that they can have a greater understanding and appreciation for the art form they practice. I believe that an understanding of the \u201cwhy\u201d is as important as the \u201cwhat\u201d. &nbsp;Having an understanding of the &#8220;why&#8221; behind the &#8220;what&#8221; helps students to develop a deeper appreciation and connection to the art form they are practicing. It also helps them to make informed choices and develop their own creative voice. Through my teaching, I hope to instill in my students a curiosity and eagerness to learn about different dance styles and their history. My goal is to not only teach them how to execute specific steps and movements but to also cultivate critical thinking skills that enable them to analyze and interpret dance in a meaningful way. Overall, my focus is to provide my students with a comprehensive and well-rounded dance education that goes beyond technical proficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My goal as an educator is to foster a love for dance and encourage self-expression and experimentation among my students. I believe that dance should be something that students enjoy, not something that they feel they have to do. I strive to nurture the drive of my students while not pushing the unwilling. To me, encouraging self-discipline is more effective than enacting external disciplines. To achieve this, I practice positive reinforcement, lead by example and work to create an environment where the dancers feel that they are in control of what they are doing. I disagree with the notion that in order to be successful you have to say \u201cyes\u201d to every aspect of dance, and I hope to keep my dancers safe by being open to communication about how they are feeling and giving alternate options for ways to participate in class. Communication and health are crucial elements of dance education that should be incorporated in all aspects of class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my teaching, I push to incorporate various theories of education, including multiple learning theories and a student-centered approach to teaching. I believe that every student learns differently, and it is my role as an educator to facilitate their learning process by incorporating various teaching strategies and techniques. My classes often begin with an opening discussion about how the students are feeling. This also is my opportunity to introduce the subject of the class and figure out their pre-existing knowledge about the concept. From there we warm up, with references and introductions to various aspects of the concept. I then incorporate exercises that allow the students to explore their own understanding of the concept before teaching skills and further developing the ideas introduced earlier in class. I then allow the students to revisit and demonstrate their own knowledge through exercises that encourage creativity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dance has immense power and can truly be anything. It is my responsibility as an educator to create a safe and supportive learning environment that allows my students to learn about themselves while exploring the world around them.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a Teacher&#8230; Photo Credit: Darren Breen<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_eb_attr":"","_monsterinsights_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0,"neve_meta_sidebar":"default","neve_meta_container":"default","neve_meta_enable_content_width":"off","neve_meta_content_width":70,"neve_meta_title_alignment":"center","neve_meta_author_avatar":"","neve_post_elements_order":"","neve_meta_disable_header":"off","neve_meta_disable_footer":"","neve_meta_disable_title":"on","_themeisle_gutenberg_block_has_review":false,"footnotes":""},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/wolfgdancecom.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/206"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/wolfgdancecom.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/wolfgdancecom.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wolfgdancecom.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wolfgdancecom.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=206"}],"version-history":[{"count":24,"href":"https:\/\/wolfgdancecom.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/206\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1201,"href":"https:\/\/wolfgdancecom.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/206\/revisions\/1201"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/wolfgdancecom.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=206"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
